# World Happiness Analysis (2022-2024)

This repository contains a data analysis project exploring World Happiness data for the years **2022, 2023, and 2024**. The analysis investigates correlations between the Happiness Score and various factors (e.g., Economy (GDP per Capita), Family, etc.), and includes year-by-year comparisons as well as visualizations.

## Overview

- **Data Source**: The raw CSV files for each year are stored in the `raw/` folder. Data was sourced from Kaggle.
- **Objective**: 
  - Clean and preprocess the data (e.g., replace commas with dots, convert to numeric, remove missing values).
  - Explore correlations using Pearson’s correlation coefficient and compute R² values.
  - Visualize relationships using scatter plots and regression lines for different years.
  - Compare the effect of including/excluding a specific year (e.g., 2023) on the overall correlation.
